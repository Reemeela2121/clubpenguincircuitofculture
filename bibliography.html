https://clubpenguin.fandom.com/wiki/Club_Penguin.
This article is a fan-made wiki page with all the details regarding Club Penguin’s history. I
can definitely use this article to summarize the lore and the creation story of Club Penguin,
as well as key events in the game’s timeline and how certain events led to the website’s
shutdown in 2017. It also mentions some fan-run servers which host the 2010 version of
Club Penguin where people can continue to play the game for completely free.

This journal publication identifies and explores the dynamics of an emerging form of
teaching and learning - social network knowledge construction - associated with the use of
social networks like Club Penguin. Dawley expands on how social networking influences
how we teach and learn, as well as how it impacts our thinking processes itself.

“Disney Plans £3m Internet Safety Campaign around Club Penguin.” The Guardian. Guardian
News and Media, July 4, 2012.
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/appsblog/2012/jul/04/disney-club-penguin-child-
safety.
This article from The Guardian in 2012 not only highlights Club Penguin’s internet safety
campaigns during that time, but also lessons the founders of Club Penguin learned about
child safety and social networking. The article mentions how children aren’t using the
platform for their own self-interests, but as a way to be a part of the Club Penguin
community and also help to better the world in whatever way they can. I remember, as a
child, that Club Penguin always hosted charity donation drives and we could donate coins
from our Club Penguin bank accounts, which was virtual money, but it ended it up
translating into something tangible we did to help the world.

This blog post summarizes and breaks down Club Penguin as an MMO, or a Massively
Multiplayer Online game, as well as gives their own personal account of how they used the
website as well as their nostalgia with the game. The blog post brings up the Johari Window
to describe identities formed on Club Penguin, and how Club Penguin is comparative to a
virtual reality game.

“Legal Disclaimer: Club Penguin Rewritten.” Community. Accessed November 4, 2021.
https://community.cprewritten.net/legal-disclaimer/.
This is the legal disclaimer of a website that copied Club Penguin’s servers when the original
Club Penguin shut down and now hosts the 2010 version of the game completely for free for
users to revel in the nostalgia and find their community. Reading through the legal disclaimer
of this site was interesting because I wanted to know how this website is able to function and
not get taken down by Disney since it did own the game before it shut down.

student-users-coronavirus-quarantine-1285830/.
This article explains the aftermath surrounding the shut-down of Club Penguin, and how fan-
made reboots of the game are allowing people to reconnect with their community during the
pandemic. It is very interesting to see how the user-base for this rebooted website has aged
since the current user-base are now high-school and college-students, which makes a lot of
sense since the current players of the game were children when the game was live in 2005. I,
myself, have played on CP Rewritten for the nostalgia when I was feeling alone in the midst
of the pandemic.

Penguin Gets More Social with Debut of New Features. Cision US Inc, June 30, 2018.

This news article was published in 2011 and was a press release to introduce new social
networking tools that Club Penguin was rolling out to its users to not only increase
engagement and make socializing on the platform easier, but also to increase safety measures
within the site since the majority of users are children. They made the safety chat feature
contain hundreds of thousands of phrases to make it easy and safe for children to
communicate, as well as expand this feature to four different languages: English, Spanish,
French, and Portuguese.

This article introduces Club Penguin to readers who may not have known what it was, as
well as explain the reason behind why the game ultimately shut down. It also gives some
background on how the creators of Club Penguin made the game and regulated the site for its
user-base (primarily children). In 2007, Club Penguin was one of the world’s most popular
social networking sites next to MySpace and Facebook.

This article explains how after-school play in commercial virtual worlds help young
children collaborate and learn digital literacies. It examines how children cooperate to teach
each other online social practices, as well as illuminate the consumerist desires they engage
in as they use their penguin avatars to participate in online peer cultures. I can use the
information gained from this publication to further study and explain the phenomenon of
consumption (in the circuit of culture) with regards to Club Penguin.
