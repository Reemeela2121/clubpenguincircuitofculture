            What were the identities of the players? How did players create their identities and what kind of affordances did Club Penguin allow for players to self-identify and create micro-communities?
            </h2>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000" style="width: 1000px"> 
            Inside the game, players identified as their penguin avatars and customized their appearance as uniquely as they wanted to, due to the plethora of accessories and items Club Penguin had to offer. Penguin avatars do not come with a set gender, 
            so players could decide to identify with whatever feminine or masculine (or neither) characteristics and represent as girl or boy using their avatar. Aesthetics were a major part of having identity within the game, since the purpose of collecting
            coins was to be able to shop clothing catalogs for your penguins. Your penguin avatar could even buy wigs and wear them! Another form of identity was whether you were a member or a non-member. Members had a special badge at the top of their profile card
            that distinguished them as paid members, meaning they had access to all the special perks. Players even did roleplaying, where they hosted themed parties in their appropriately-decorated igloos and pretended that they were pilots or kings or restaurant owners.
            <br><br> 
            Outside of the game, players continued expressing their identities as Club Penguin players and fans through creating fan-art, original characters, wrote fanfiction, and participated in forums about Club Penguin-related lore and news.
